Hi,

This project currently has only two users "abc@abc.com" with password as"1234" and email="xyz@xyz.com" password="5678" 

You can enter the webpage from intel.html which is the login page where you can enter your email and password to sign in and it returns approppriate messages when wrong credentials are entered
when the entered email and password are correct you will get a success message and it will take you to the dashboard which is the user's personal mail box.

The dashboard consists of a collapsable menu and a static menu. There is a compose button which when clicked opens a pop up window which you can use to send mails.
For example if you are logged in as "abc@abc.com", in the "To" feild you can enter "xyz@xyz.com" add your subject and body and click on send mail. now if you log out and login as "xyz@xyz.com" you will find the mail you just sent.

You can log out by clickinng the logout button on the top right.

The project is not 100% completed but i tried my best in the limited time i had inhand.
This is in no-way the best repesntation of my skills but i hope it enough for you to get an idea.

This was a fun project. Thanks a lot.
